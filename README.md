Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/najzeko/steam-reviews-2021

We analyzed a Steam user review dataset that contains 21 millions of records, and designed a database schema to store data on Hive. In this notebook, I used PySpark to perform sentiment analysis and build a video game recommendation system with ALS model from Sprak MLlib on the English reviews.
